        Keep base machine as swarm leader
        Spin up 2 vagrants (if machine supports) and configure them as worker nodes

    Update docker swarm cluster
        Inspect the leader and worker nodes
        Remove a worker node from the cluster
        Add a worker node back into the cluster

    Deploy a tomcat service onto the cluster
        Run 1 container of tomcat
        Scale tomcat service to 3 containers
        Inspect running service
        Remove tomcat service.
